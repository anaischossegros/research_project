# Unsupervised Learning of Clinical Scales

Author: Ana√Øs Chossegros

## Project Description

This project compares three models predictions to perform survival analysis. The use case is to predict survival time from patients with cancer. The accuracy is measured with the C-index metric.

## Installation

With a Python 3.7.13 environment, install the necessary packages with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Export the data files from their raw format to `.tsv`



#### Download the data

The data for the project can be found with the TCGA portal. The gene expressions are collected from the rna_seq.augmented_star_gene_counts files. 
The associated clinical file and metadata file can be downloaded.
